* in type script how we define the int and float
*we don't define it they are simply call as numbers 

```
//Number, boolean, and type inference

let userId: number = 5678.9

console.log(userId.toFixed())

//boolean

let value: boolean = true

console.log(value.valueOf())
```



# Any

* where to use any as a developer it is not recommended to use any extensively as it is not a good practice.
* it breaks the consistency of the code 
* any is not a special keyword it is just a marker that says i don't want to do type checking just turn it off.
example : ->

```
let student;

function getOff() {

    return "Hello";

}

student =  getOff;
export {}

```
