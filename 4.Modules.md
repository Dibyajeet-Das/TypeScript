# Module Architecture

Angular's **module architecture** uses **NgModules** to organize applications into cohesive units. These modules group related components, directives, pipes, and services, promoting modular development. Key types include the **root module** (entry point), **feature modules** (specific functionality, often lazily loaded), and **shared modules** (reusable code). This approach significantly enhances code organization, scalability, and maintainability.
(after angular 17 everything is standalone means everything can be injected or use anywhere no more Ngmodule currently we are using the AppModule 
**Modules are still supported just like previous versions**)

Angular's module architecture uses NgModules to bundle your app's pieces—like components, services, and pipes—into organized groups, making big apps easier to build and maintain.

#### What is an NgModule

An NgModule is like a folder for related code: it declares what belongs inside (components, directives, pipes), lists imported modules it needs, and exports what others can reuse. Every Angular app starts with one—think of it as a declaration list telling Angular "these pieces work together."
#### Root Module
The main entry point (usually app.module.ts). It bootstraps your root component (AppComponent) and imports essentials like BrowserModule. Everything kicks off here—your app's front door.[](https://angular.dev/api/core/ChangeDetectionStrategy)​
#### Feature Modules
Break your app into chunks for specific features, like user profiles or shopping cart. Load them lazily (on-demand) to speed up initial app load. Great for teams: one team owns one module.[](https://angular.dev/api/core/ChangeDetectionStrategy)​
#### Shared Modules
Holds reusable stuff like common components (buttons), pipes, or services that multiple feature modules need. Import once, use everywhere—avoids duplication.[](https://angular.dev/api/core/ChangeDetectionStrategy)​

Declare it with `@NgModule({ declarations: [...], imports: [...], exports: [...] })`. Start simple with root module; split into features as your app grows for better performance and organization.
(**Lazy Loading**: Only load parts of the app when they are needed, improving performance.)



# Feature Modules

Feature modules are `NgModules` for the purpose of organizing code. With feature modules, you can keep code related to a specific functionality or feature separate from other code. Delineating areas of your application helps with collaboration between developers and teams, separating directives, and managing the size of the root module.
