# Standalone
A standalone component is a component that sets `standalone: true` in its component metadata. Standalone components directly import other components, directives, and pipes used in their templates

- `standalone: true` means it can live without being declared in any module.
- `imports: [CommonModule, ChildComponent]` tells Angular exactly **which** directives/components this template uses (`*ngIf` comes from `CommonModule`, `<app-child>` from `ChildComponent`).

# Imports
The `imports` property specifies the `standalone` component's template dependencies — those directives, components, and pipes that can be used within its template.

Standalone components don't belong to any NgModule, so they can't "borrow" features from a shared module. The `imports` array acts like a shopping list: it tells Angular "give me these tools for my template."


# Provider
Configure the injector of component with a token that maps to a provider of a dependency.
Providers in Angular tell the Dependency Injection (DI) system **how to create and provide** services or values when components ask for them.


# Encapsulation
Encapsulation in Angular controls how your component's CSS styles stay isolated from the rest of your app, preventing style leaks—like making sure one button's red color doesn't accidentally turn all buttons red across your page.

There are three different types attributes of basically in angular by default we get emulated but we can also try other two as well below is the explanation of how thinks work 

### 1.Emulated (Default)

Angular fakes Shadow DOM by adding unique attributes (like _ngcontent-c123) to your component's HTML elements and tweaking your CSS selectors at build time. Your styles only hit elements inside that component, but global styles (from styles.css) can still reach in. If your component has no styles at all, Angular auto-switches to None for efficiency.​

### 2.ShadowDom

Uses the browser's real Shadow DOM (a #shadow-root bubble around your component). Styles are 100% locked in—nothing leaks out, and global styles can't get in. Great for reusable widgets, but older browsers might not support it fully.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35651993/diff-between-viewencapsulation-native-viewencapsulation-none-and-viewencapsulat)​

### 3.None

No walls at all—your styles go global and can affect the whole app (and vice versa). Use sparingly, like for shared utility classes or third-party libs that need global reach.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/angular-js/view-encapsulation-in-angular/)​

Set it in your @Component decorator: `encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated`. Defaults to Emulated from your compiler options, so beginners rarely need to touch it


# changeDetection
The data with the component and view are always with sync with each other. 
(every component has a change detector reads the binding of the template)

The change-detection strategy to use for this component. When a component is instantiated, Angular creates a change detector, which is responsible for propagating the component's bindings. The strategy is one of:

- `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` sets the strategy to Check Once (on demand).
- `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default` sets the strategy to Check Always.
Angular constantly scans your app's data (like variables bound to the template) whenever something happens—a button click, timer tick, or data fetch. If data changed, it refreshes the view (DOM). This tree-like scan starts from the top component and goes down, ensuring views match data
### Default Strategy
Always on: Angular checks the entire component tree on every event (CheckAlways mode). Reliable for small apps or beginners, but wasteful in big apps—it rescans unchanged parts too.​

### OnPush Strategy
Smarter: Only checks when inputs change (new reference), an event fires inside the component, async pipe emits, or you manually trigger it (CheckOnce mode). Pairs well with immutable data—update by creating new objects, not mutating old ones. Use for list items or static displays to boost speed.​
